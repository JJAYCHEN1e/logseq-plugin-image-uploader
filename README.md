# Usage

## Installation
- Download lates [release](https://github.com/JJAYCHEN1e/logseq-plugin-image-uploader/releases) of the plugin.
- Open Logseq Desktop client and turn on Developer mode in user settings panel
- Open the toolbar dot menus and navigate to plugins page
- Read the README file
- Navigate to the plugins dashboard: `t` `p`
- Click Load unpacked plugin button, then select the sample directory to load it

## How to use?

Currently, we only support [PicGo](https://github.com/Molunerfinn/PicGo), so please open PicGo manually.

Right click any block' dot to show its context menu, and select `Upload image`. All image detected in that block will be uploaded, and replaced with an remote URL.

## Note

Since we don't have any permission to operate the file system in a logseq plugin, we can't delete the original file saved by logseq. So we create a page named **"Uploaded image file record(created by logseq-plugin-image-uploader)"** to save all the images we uploaded. You can delete them manually. (One image path actually can appear more than once in that page, for example, you use that image many times, and you upload them more than once)

We may provide a script to delete those images in the future.

# FAQ

## Why only PicGo is supported?
Currently, logseq plugin is runnning in a browser only sandbox, which means we can't access the file system or execute any local scripts. PicGo provides a local server to upload images by HTTP(s) request, we choose PicGo as a start point. If we want to support more image uploading softwares, either they provide similar fearture, or we should launch a local server with Logseq Desktop client.

## I failed to upload with PicGO.
First, make sure PicGo is running, and the check [PicGo server](https://picgo.github.io/PicGo-Doc/en/guide/config.html#picgo-server-setting) is configured to run at port `36677`. We'll provide a setting for the plugin in the future.
